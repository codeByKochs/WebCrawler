# Web Crawler

This is a simple web crawler with a graphical user interface. General info on web crawlers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)
This web crawler searches for links on the given start page, saves their corresponding page title and link and repeats the process for the found links.
The search results can be exported into a .txt file.

## Additional Information

This project is a learning project and serves no direct purpose besides documenting my learning progress. It was based on  hyperskill's Web Crawler project, which can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/59?goal=7)
I used this project to learn and integrate several programming topics. Those topics include not exclusively:

- use of regexes, patterns, matchers
- multithreading
- saving of files
- GUI design with Swing
- working with timers
