This project is based on hyperskill's Web Crawler project, which can be found here:

This is a simple web crawler with a graphical user interface. General info on web crawlers can be found here:

I used this project to learn and integrate several programming topics. Those topics include not exclusively:
- use of regexes, patterns, matchers
- multithreading
- saving of files
- GUI design with Swing
- working with timers
- using Git and GitHub
